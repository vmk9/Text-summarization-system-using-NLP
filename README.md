# Text-summarization-system-using-NLP

This project was a part of my graduate course Applied Natural Language Processing-BUAN 6342. The dataset was provided and we have to work on it individually. This is my solution to the problem. I have developed an automatic text summarization system using NLTK and spaCy. 

Project objective:

we need to summarize the day's news for the committee and highlight the ten most important stories that you think the 
committee should focus on. With limited time to read every news article in detail, we want to use an 
automatic text summarization system to quickly generate a summary of the news headlines. This is where 
the automatic text summarization system developed in this project comes in handy. We can use the 
system to quickly generate a summary of the news headlines and identify the ten most important stories 
based on the summary. This will save us time and ensure that you are well-informed before the committee meeting.
